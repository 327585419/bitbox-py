Contributing to Bitbox-py
=============================

Features, improvements and bug fixes are welcome to Bitbox-py! Fork this project and issue [pull requests](https://github.com/merwane/bitbox-py/compare).
New code ideally comes with a set of unit tests (that pass!) before the pull request is merged.

Adding features
--------------
Since this repository is a port of [Gabriel Cardona](https://github.com/cgcardona)'s [Bitbox-sdk](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/bitbox-sdk), you can find plenty of features you can add that are not ported to Bitbox-py yet. Bitbox-sdk is originaly written in Typescript.

### Features you can add:
* The ability to get BitDB data by query.
* ECPair utilities (fromWIF, fromPublicKey etc)
* HDNode methods (fromSeed, derive etc)
* Schnorr utilities
* TransactionBuilder methods

Reporting Bugs

Bugs can be filed as [Issues on github.](https://github.com/merwane/bitbox-py/issues/new)
